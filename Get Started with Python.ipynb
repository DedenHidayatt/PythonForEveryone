    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a versatile and popular programming language that’s perfect for beginners and experienced developers alike. With its simple syntax and vast community support, Python is ideal for everything from web development to data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will help you write your first Python code, understand the basic concepts, and get you comfortable with using Jupyter Notebook for your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "2. Choose the version that suits your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "3. Follow the installation instructions. Make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\" during the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an excellent tool for writing and running Python code interactively. It’s widely used in data science but also great for beginners because it lets you see your code output immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Install Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have Python installed, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
